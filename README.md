# frappy

**frappy** is a Python package implementing a non subjective algorithm for calculating correlation dimensions from data.

This package currently contains functions for:

- Converting a time series into a uniform deviate through a rank transformation
- Embedding time series into a d-dimensional vector space
- Calculate correlation dimension at different embedding dimensions
- Calculate saturated correlation dimension and minimum embedding dimension using curve fitting
